    <li>The API that I selected is a dictionary database for vocabulary used in
        Vedic literature, or in other words, vocabulary from the Vedas--ancient
        Sanskrit texts, considered to be some of the primary scriptures of Hinduism.
    </li>
    <li>This website this data was found at is
        <a href="https://aninditabasu.github.io/indica/html/vs.html">
        https://aninditabasu.github.io/indica/html/vs.html</a>
    </li>
    <li>This API request did not require an API key, but the search required
        that either the word, the description, or the category of the word to
        be specified. Partial searches were also acceptable, like the one that
        I did, where I searched for words beginning with "rajan-". By changing
        the key-value pair at the end of the URL, I could search for words
        related to the nobility with "category=royalty", or words referring to
        a king with "description=king", or a specific word with
        "word=rajakartri".
    <li>I think one application where this API would be helpful is a historian
        or a linguist interested in studying the language, since the API also
        includes the original Nagari script, so it might be referenced for
        translation or comparison to other languages.
        <br>
        I think another way this might be useful is for someone trying to read
        the original Vedas manuscripts or wants to know if a modern word were
        present in them, it could be a useful tool for quickly finding simple,
        synonymous definitions of words that they don't understand or can't
        translate.
