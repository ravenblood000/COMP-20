    <h2>Who We Are:</h2>
    <p> Founded around 1850 by Chinese and Japanese immigrants, Wasabi has
        practiced a longstanding tradition of passing down our recipies
        directly, from owner to owner, chef to chef. We take pride in providing
        a pleasant and welcoming dine-in service for parties of all sizes.
        We truly believe that the best way to bring people together is not
        only through food, but with a sharing of cultures and beliefs. And
        though our small restaurant has exchanged hands many times throughout
        the generations, our motivation to stay true to our customers and
        our mission to bring them a taste of cuisine from our homelands in a
        genuine and meaningful way stands firm.
    </p>
    <h2>What We Do:</h2>
    <p> Our food is top-quality Asian cuisine from both China and Japan,
        brought straight to your table! Whether it's spicy tuna rolls or long
        buckwheat noodles, any dish you like is made with meticuous care and
        attention. Our waiters and hosts are always happy to help you, and our
        establishment is designed with your comfort and enjoyment in mind.
        If there you have any inconvenience at all that you wish to alert us
        of, or if there is any feedback you think would help to improve our
        establishment, please visit our "Contact Us" page and get in touch

       <h2>In These Troubling Times...</h2>
    <p>
       Due to restictions on dine-in eating placed in these times of pandemics
       and quarantine, we are sorry that only a very limited amount of dine-in
       eating is allowed in our restaurant. Our tables have been widely spaced
       to accommodate to social distancing guidelines, and we strive to
       continue serving food in only the most sanitary conditions and to
       dinner tables all around the Medford community. Thank you for your
       understanding!
